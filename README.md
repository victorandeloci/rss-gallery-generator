# rss-gallery-generator
Generate a RSS Feed based on a directory containing audio files and automatically display it in a page/gallery

## Info
The RSS generator part was created based in this amazing [gist](https://gist.github.com/vsoch/4898025919365bf23b6f)

I got info from files based in [getID3](https://github.com/JamesHeinrich/getID3/). It's a submodule, located in feed/getID3
